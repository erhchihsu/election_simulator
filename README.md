## Background
Election simulators use statistical methods to analyze poll results and consider various factors to predict the likelihood of different election outcomes.

## Components
* Randomly select the number of voters in this district.
* Randomly determine the percentage of votes our candidate received in this district.
* Multiply these two values to calculate our candidate's vote count in this district.
* Add the votes our candidate received to the total votes cast in this district, updating the overall totals.
* Calculate the overall percentage of votes our candidate received across all districts.
* Round each percentage to two decimal places and display the results.
* Incorporate the turnout and votes earned in this simulation into the overall totals.
* Visualize the votes.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with Java involving following techniques:
* print/printlns
* types, expressions
* variables, strings
* for loops/nested for loops
* random, constant
* methods
* parameters
	
## Note
This repository is a personal record of codes based on the programming assignment, which not related or affiliated with the course.
